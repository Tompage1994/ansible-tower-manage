ansible-tower-manage
=========

**PLEASE NOTE: This repository is now deprecated in favour of the [redhat_cop.tower_configuration collection](https://github.com/redhat-cop/tower_configuration.git)**


Ansible role to install and manage the configuration of Ansible Tower. It includes the ability to add configuration objects such as projects, job tempaltes, credentials, inventories and many more.

Please note this repository is still in development but being transitioned to usign the AWX collection (`awx.awx`) under the `awx` branch.

Requirements
------------

Users can seed Tower objects by passing a variable `tower_objects` that contains a dictionary of objects. This readme contains an example set of high level objects that can be used as a guide. Each object has a distinct set of variables that it can consume, based upon the appropriate Ansible module employed. For example, the `organisation` object can take `name` and `description` as valid variables. Most objects has been documented within the example `tower_objects`, use it as a guide for your seeding activities.

The role heavily utilises the existing `tower_*` Ansible modules, which in turn leverage the `tower-cli`.

The role can install all pre-requisites on the target (eg `python-virtualenv` and `python-setuptools`) as well as install tower-cli inside a venv in order to complete the above tasks, but it does require access to the appropriate RHEL/CentOS channels and access to PyPi.

A valid `license.json` file needs to be supplied using variable `tower_manage_licence` so that it can be uploaded to Tower once installed.
```yaml
tower_manage_licence: "{{ lookup('file','license.json') }}"
```

There are no other strict Role dependencies.

Testing
-------

This role makes use of the [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) testing framework. At present only linting is implemented, but additional testing is planned to be implemented.

In order to run the tests do the following:

```sh
pip install molecule>3
molecule test
```
